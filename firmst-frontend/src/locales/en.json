      "experience":"I was purposed to pursue the two goals: to get a clinical experience in Neurology and start a scientific work and publish under the leadership of experts from AIMS, and both of them have been reached. I was posted both in the outpatient (OP) and inpatient (IP) departments, talked to the English-speaking patients and their relatives, performed the neurological exam and wrote the notes under the supervision of the doctors from the center and could even sign them by my name, close to the name of the supervisor, participated in the bedside rounds and gran rounds, went to the Neuroimmunology lab to learn the technique of some tests, collected the data for the research from the database, brainstormed on the research topic, worked with statistics and convened a research from a scratch to a full-text paper in English under the supervision. I cannot thank enough my scientific supervisor, Dr. Kannoth, the dean of the Department of Medicine at that time, Dr. Marwaha, and all the AIMS team for what they have done for me.",
      "findingHead": "How did you find this rotation?",
      "finding": "I have been an EAFO volunteer for years after I participated and won at the EAFO Basic Oncology Courses back in 2019. I was aimed to apply for the Presidential grant to Study Abroad of the Russian Federation and searched for the places to go and Dr. Soma suggested AIMS. Luckily, they were ready to accept me for the externship in the midst of COVID..! As a FIRMST co-founder I was a part of the EAFO team and Dr. Soma and the other members of the team helped me tremendously. Without them, I wouldn’t have been able to do it.",
      "projectsHead": "Were there any long-haul projects of any kind as a result of this internship?",
      "projects": "Yes. We’ve published one paper with my first authorship in the peer-reviewed Q1 journal and presented two of our works at the American Academy of Neurology conferences in 2022 and 2024, another manuscript is currently awaiting publication. ",
      "adviceHead": "Any advice what could be improved in the externship?",
      "advice":"I think, overall everything was amazing, everyone was helpful and kind to me. The only thing what I think could have been improved (but mostly from my side) is to determine realistic and reachable goals and concentrate on one-two major purposes. During my rotation I had to prepare for the international exam in medicine and in language proficiency, and this slowed down my research activities and clinical learning. Also, I had some unexpected (though so fabulous and memorable!) trips across India with my old or new friends which also, for the sake of wiser time management, could be planned in advance.",
      "difficultiesHead": "Which difficulties you had to overcome and where you wish you could have any help with?",
      "difficulties":"One of the worst things I had is that the stipend funds for some technical reasons could not be released for me immediately and in this situation EAFO team helped me tremendously and I am very-very grateful for this. Then, when I first came to Kochi I was thinking I could find some options to living somewhere rather that in the hotel, which could be a little costly. Although I managed to find a friend of my friend’s friend (:D) there we couldn’t find anything fitting me, so I stayed at the hotel. I would have been happy if I had some good options in advance. And the last, I think, although all the doctors and many patients in that part of India speak English, in some situations I had some difficulties in communication and had to learn very-very basics of the native language.

  "experience":"My observership began with a month in a bone marrow transplantation unit, followed by three weeks in the hematology department at Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research & Education in Cancer (ACTREC) at the Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai. ACTREC, a leading Asian oncology center, provided invaluable exposure to advanced medical technology and high-volume patient care. I participated in patient examinations, treatment discussions and significantly expanded my hematology knowledge. Concurrently, I gained experience in clinical research methodology, from data collection and study design to statistical analysis. I collaborated with Indian colleagues on a research protocol for Hodgkin lymphoma. In November 2022, I attended a major Indian hematology conference in Kolkata. In December 2022, I spent at the hematology department of the University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS) in Delhi, where I gained valuable experience in managing patients with thalassemia and hemophilia – conditions less commonly encountered in Russia. The final two months of my observership were spent at the Tata Medical Centre in Kolkata, observing both outpatient and inpatient care and actively participating in multidisciplinary discussions of difficult clinical cases.",
  "findingHead": "How did you find this rotation?",
  "finding": "Since 2021 I've volunteered with EAFO: i was a scientific coordinator of 7th EAFO Hematology Forum and Basic Courses on Oncology. Inspired by my colleague and friend, Ekaterina Popova, I applied for a Russian Presidential Scholarship for international study. My mentor and founder of EAFO and ECRC, Dr. Soma, suggested India, home to leading oncology centers partnering with the Eurasian Council for Cancer Research (ECRC).",
  "projectsHead": "Were there any long-haul projects of any kind as a result of this internship?",
  "projects": "Yes, the professional connections I established with Indian colleagues during my observership have already yielded significant results. Experts from ACTREC served as international speakers at the Hodgkin Lymphoma Conference at the Pirogov National Medical Surgical Center (where I am currently completing my residency) in April and December 2023 and October 2024. Furthermore, we are collaborating on a joint grant application to the Russian Science Foundation (RSF) and the Department of Science and Technology (DST) of India’s Ministry of Science and Technology. The insights I gained from observing the organization of the international hematology conference in Kolkata directly informed my work in coordinating the ECRC-EAFO Seminar on Academic Research in Oncology (SACROH-2023) and in organizing workshops and forums on Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma at the Pirogov National Medical Surgical Center.",
  "adviceHead": "Any advice what could be improved in the externship?",
  "advice":"I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of my observership! It was a pivotal step in my professional development, deepening my hematological knowledge, preparing me for my residency, improving my English language skills and providing invaluable experience working with leading experts. Observing the organization of oncology care in various hospitals shaped my understanding of best clinical practice. I successfully achieved all my observership goals.",
  "difficultiesHead": "Which difficulties you had to overcome and where you wish you could have any help with?",
  "difficulties":"One significant challenge I faced was a delay in receiving my Presidential Scholarship funds due to technical issues upon arrival. Thankfully, the EAFO team stepped in with critical support to resolve the issue. Communication with colleagues was occasionally hindered by their use of local languages, creating challenges in both routine work and beyond. However, I have overcome this by learning some basic Hindi phrases and words.",

"experienceHead": "What did you do during the rotation?",
"experience":"The main goal of the internship was to master basic practical skills in the field of diagnostics of non-oncological and oncological diseases of haematolymphoid organs besides that to form an integrated approach to the perception of continuity of cytological diagnostics in conjunction with morphological diagnostics due to the differences compared to Russian practice. Pathologists carried out both cytological and morphological diagnostics 'не отходя от кассы', which made, having opened their mouths, during the whole time of stay there to be surprised how cleverly and fully, and, most importantly, much more effective this approach looked.",

    "paragraph1": "FIRMST Study Abroad is a platform for tailoring personalized plan for international clinical or scientific rotations in many fields of Medicine and Allied Sciences. We are aimed to facilitate a better experience of away externships by working with reliable partner institutions, orchestrating official paperwork and helping deal with organizational issues before and during the rotation. We have already had much positive feedback from students and doctors who had such experience and eventually come to the decision to launch a full-fledged international exchange program. You can be the next candidate!",

    "paragraph2": "Some of you may have already heard about the <a class='text-blue-700 underline font-semibold' href='https://www.firmst.tech/' target ='_blank'> FIRMST Forum </a> – or even taken part in it. The FIRMST Forum (Forum for Interdisciplinary Research in Medical Science and Technology), first launched in 2020 by a team of enthusiastic students, has since evolved into an independent initiative under the leadership of its founder and director, <a class='text-blue-700 underline font-semibold' href='https://www.drsoma.info/' target='_blank'> Dr. Somasundaram SUBRAMANIAN (Dr. Soma)</a> surgical oncologist and philanthropist, and the Founder & CEO, of the <a class='text-blue-700 underline font-semibold' href='https://www.eafo.info/' target='_blank'> Eurasian Federation of Oncology (EAFO)</a> The forum has a broad scope of interest and covers numerous fields in medicine and related sciences.",
    "paragraph3": "Over time, many members of our team have graduated from university or achieved professional milestones, including internships with leading experts both abroad and in Russia. At different stages, they were inspired by former EAFO scholars or colleagues who had received support through various initiatives led by Dr. Soma since 1998 — whether through connections with international specialists or guidance from seasoned professionals within EAFO, FIRMST, and partner organizations. <br><br>Preparing for an internship from scratch is a time- and energy-consuming process — and we know this firsthand. Now, the time has come to share this experience with you and help tailor the process to your personal goals. Together, we can contribute to a better future for patients and the advancement of science and technology."
